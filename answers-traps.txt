- Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
    a0,a1,a2. register a2 holds 13.

- Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
   can't find the call,because function f were optimized.
   g : addi	sp,sp,-16

- At what address is the function printf located?
    630
- What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
    0x38

- Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      
- What is the output? 
    hex(57616) = 0xe110 72-r 6c-l 64-d
    He110 World
- If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output?    
    0x726c6400
- Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?    
    No


- In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
  depend on a2.
